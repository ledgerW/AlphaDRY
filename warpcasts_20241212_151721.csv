A lifelong builder and early Coinbase employee, Carl ventured out on his own to build something new in crypto. He ended up launching a protocol that enables ""evolutionary memecoins"".

That means that the ticker, name, and image can change based on the market cap. Holders also get NFTs to show that they bought in early. It's an interesting concept and I am curious to see how it goes.

Lastly, Carl was not aware of /higher when he chose the name and launched the protocol, so he is now looking for a sensible way to align with and contribute to higher via higherrrrrrr. Listen in and check it out.

The plan is to move out of alpha in the coming weeks.

Here's the current protocol source: https://github.com/Thrive-Point-Group/higherrrrrrr-protocol

Bugs we need to fix: 
- We didn't unit test the display amounts on the decimals on the ETH amount on the NFTs :( this needs to be fixed. 

Features we want to add: 
- Token type enum to a higherrrrrrr token (""regular"" ie a regular meme coin, ""text_evolution"", ""image_evolution"") - depending on which enum is selected in the token creation, the token will behave differently
- Support for image uri evolutions in the protocol 

Deliverables: 
- Working source in a PR to the OSS 
- Audit through Almanax (DM me for info on this)

Expect the diff for this to be 100-200 lines, so not a huge change. 

Bonus points if you're a student or younger developer looking to get involved. 

Thanks!

- i worked more on my girly AI agent $jessy aka @friesgpt :
a) now the bot has a short memory 
b) we fine-tuned it a bit more with my dev, i'm always testing wat works best so that $jessy would shitpost like me, keeping the sentences short and sounding like a human, because at the end of the day that's wat makes her different from other ai agents: her own personality.
c) $jessy is now more autonomous and can quote-cast and tag users on farcaster

- i minted an intro on zora to explain what's my goal with @friesgpt as well as the context, so users would understand where i come from and that project started already back in 2023

let's keep building

one of the earliest and most iconic examples of public domain assets within the nft space.

what began as a simple yet profound idea:  stick figures embodying the ethos of “mfers do what they want” and “we all mfers” and “mfers just getting started” has since evolved into a global movement.

three years later, the community of crypto enthusiasts and creators inspired by this ethos continues to expand in ways no one could have foreseen…

and now the mfer heartbeat echoes across nearly every corner of the crypto space, woven into countless projects, communities, and cultural movements.

it’s a reminder that simplicity, humor, and the spirit of doing what you want can inspire innovation and bring people together in unexpected ways.

mfers remain a testament to the power of decentralization, permissionless creativity, and the cultural value of shared assets fueled by memetic energy…anchored in digital ownership and property rights.",1732987266000,18085,mleejr,mleejr,26603,1013,35,6,15,0,,True,ace

So when the pool is created, there is no ETH, just 100% supply of the newly created token. So no real dollars are put in to start.

But how it has a $30k marketcap is that the one sided liquidity is priced so that to buy the tokens you have to buy them at the set price.

For example, say there is 1 million tokens. Each token would be set at $0.03 to start so the market cap is $30k.

As soon as Clanker came out 17 days ago, i launched a token.. one of the very first Clankers

Didnt promote it, barely bought it myself and forgot about it.. now i was asking some feedback if i could bring it back to life and people just started aping in.. for the culture you know.. so now its slightly pumping

Especially since @proxystudio.eth announced the degen x clanker integration.. i think that the $HAT could be something..

Hey Ham 🍖 friends. I decided to onboard with a new Caster Token on the Hamchain. Behold $GANJA by Geoffrey, aka Potdealer. I locked my 5 million caster tokens away for two years and bought another $125k to play with. I set the payouts to 69% and 42%, but that will probably change once I gain a better understanding of how this all works. Thanks to all those like @burrrrrberry who offered some guidance. Much obliged!",1733935039000,269735,potdealer,Geoffrey,164,141,16,5,5,0,burrrrrberry,True,deployer

here's a couple of challenges channels/mods typically face:
- takes a lot of effort and time to browse and identify good content in the channel
- once you identify the users, its cumbersome to send out the rewards, especially if there's many users and distribution is done frequently.

we launched channel points and rankings a few days ago. now mods can use these leaderboards to reward members daily/weekly/retroactively with 1-click!

1. login to cura and head to Distribute Rewards
2. create a reward drop - enter token to distribute, amount, # recipients based on daily leaderboard, lifetime leaderboard, openrank rankings.
3. connect wallet and send - rewards are automatically dispatched to the verified address of the FID. soon you'll be able to send a DC to the recipients.",1733516490000,725,sahil,sahil,7466,302,78,3,15,0,base,True,deployer

Bankr is in beta. Please report any bugs! This is just the beginning for Bankr. Using Bankr to buy coins makes going to Uniswap and using Metamask an outdated system. Now you can buy coins right from your social feed within seconds by simply tagging Bankr and telling it what coins you want, or responding to a cast that has that information. 

A portion of all fees goes towards buying $TN100x. See the quoted cast for all the details!

🔵 I have connected the airstack api to load the profile data and get informations about the user on different chains.

🔵 I am collecting the user data from ham chain to get the personal caster and tipping token of the users if they own one.

🔵 I have added the user specific tokens to the token selector 

🔵 I have added a link to the transactions at the chain specific block explorer after distributing tokens for your control. 

🔵 Built a complete caster selector to make the process of distributing tokens to your friends super easy. 

🔵 I have added more distribution methods like direct and evenly distribution 

🔵 all erc20 tokens on BASE and HAM are supported 

We have distributed millions of tokens so far.

Hamcaster acts as a flywheel for the ecosystem. The Degen team really kicked off the tipping meta which inspired Ham to take it further and implement onchain tipping and a registry for tipping symbols (think ENS for tipping symbols) called the Onchain Tipping Registry. 

There's some work being done now to expand this system into THE decentralized tipping protocol that projects like Degen and Ham can use as well as any other project or community that might benefit by distributing a portion of their token via tipping. 

I think tipping becomes a social primitive. And we are building systems to support this. 

Regarding Hamcaster, I just like tipping my own token. Its like an extension of the like button, but additionally there's a silly social defi system that you can use to stake my token and earn Ham, convertible 1:1 w/ TN100x

Lately, people really pushed the boundaries of v1 frames ( /spotlight is a good example, or the waifu frame, some of the analytics frames became absolute staples of the feed, matthew fox built out miniapps, we've had it all. but frames v2 feels much more like a feature that might get meaningful adoption, that can provide experiences in client that rival our app competitors.

one of the earliest and most iconic examples of public domain assets within the nft space.

what began as a simple yet profound idea:  stick figures embodying the ethos of “mfers do what they want” and “we all mfers” and “mfers just getting started” has since evolved into a global movement.

three years later, the community of crypto enthusiasts and creators inspired by this ethos continues to expand in ways no one could have foreseen…

and now the mfer heartbeat echoes across nearly every corner of the crypto space, woven into countless projects, communities, and cultural movements.

it’s a reminder that simplicity, humor, and the spirit of doing what you want can inspire innovation and bring people together in unexpected ways.

mfers remain a testament to the power of decentralization, permissionless creativity, and the cultural value of shared assets fueled by memetic energy…anchored in digital ownership and property rights.",1732987266000,18085,mleejr,mleejr,26603,1013,35,6,15,0,,,mleejr

-dev tokens unlock either at duration or at bonding complete
-write a prompt and ai generates image ticker and description

As we wrapped up the 6-week Build Camp, we ended on a high note. This was my first global web 3 team project, and I was honestly scared at first.

But I was lucky to have such amazing teammates, and together, we spent six wonderful weeks turning the idea for the Butter’s Dream project into a concrete, achievable plan 🧈🪽

I wasn’t confident about being a team leader, creating videos, or making & giving presentations. But I gave it my all, and I feel like I finished without any regrets!

It’s been exactly 6 months since I first learned about Web3. Joining Warpcast and taking part in various projects have helped me grow so much, and I owe it all to the /hunt team. Thank you so much for raising me into a Web3 baby builder! 🍅🍼

if you've been around the block, you may have noticed that the curly hair trait isn't part of sartoshi's original collection.

when this mfer, @prettycoolmfer , was picking up an mfer shortly after mint, she saw there weren't any mfers in the collection that had curly hair like she did.

sartoshi minted this curly mfer on jan 13 2022 and sent it to prettycoolmfer, and it's been her pfp ever since.

lots of mfers sport a curly-haired mfer these days; you can find the trait in some derivatives and on a couple of the builders to make your own.

this curly mfer on purple is where it started.",1729303402000,265951,imp0ster,imp0ster,1419,398,29,6,9,0,prettycoolmfer,True,mleejr

First, thanks to all of you who supported me on the /larry launch round. This was a huge and very cool surprise!

Here's the quick update on where things are at:
- Looking into Buck AI
- Have some ideas and chatting with people
- Registered both a channel and user
- Still have a lot to learn on both the AI and Web3 sides
- Not committed to any ideas yet and have a few prior commitments before I really start diving in
- The name, logo, and lore were all spur of the moment, but I actually really like it so will probably hack on it regardless of token price, unless there's something urgent otherwise.

Beyond that, always DYOR and NFA.

The result was that round participants had very little downside - they’re only losing if other holders (3 eth) sell more than the open market buys

since any launch has a lot of attention in first 4 hours its very low risk to swing trade. Buy in at entry price, sell after a couple of hours. Snipers are doing similar. 

this creates very volatile launches that can be helpful for attention, but can also kill community and capital formation by early entrants post rounds exiting to cut losses, and leave creators feeling sheepish

1/ 

1. Scores are not evenly distributed, higher scores are increasingly difficult to get. No one would expect everyone with access to credit to have a perfect 850 credit score. Same with social scores. For developers, we recommend starting with a threshold between 0.5-0.6 and moving up/down as needed.

2. If you're building with scores, there's no need to set a super high threshold. That artificially reduces the number of users who can interact with your product. Imagine only giving loans to people with 850 credit score, pretty much no one would have access to credit.

3. Only 27k+ users have scores 0.7 or higher at this time, the protocol has 800k+ users. There's really no need to worry about a low scores unless you're actually in the bottom digits. You can see a live dashboard of the distribution here: https://bit.ly/3ZQItzH. We are working on model improvements and we expect more users to move up the score ladder.",1733505322000,194,rish,rish,255911,801,123,7,18,0,,True,df

TLDR; Generally happy with the direction, but I think there's a missed opportunity with actions as they stand, as Frames in v2 won't be able to interact with each other in any way. 
By adding a new type of Frame action that is a limited version of Frames v1 we can get the best of both worlds; performance and expressivity via Frames v2, and safe composability from a limited version of Frames v1.

Farcaster is being controlled & governed by the 99% client (Warpcast), repeatedly making choices that limit the ability of alternate clients to build and compete (See SIWF, Messaging, Channels).

As a builder, it's unclear why Farcaster is not any different from early Twitter, which was open, had alt clients, but one overwhelmingly dominant client. Once Twitter became big enough, it shifted from attracting to extracting, and shut down their API, becoming the Twitter of today, ruled by a benevolent dictator. Is Farcaster/Warpcast just running back the Twitter playbook? 

Why should we users and builders trust Warpcast's continued benevolence, when their short term choices are already showing a willingness to compromise on the Protocol part in the name of monoclient growth?",1731931457000,1214,df,df,122115,2151,141,13,37,0,,,df

Maiton is a components library for your frames projects (yes! shadcn but for frames 👀)

As frame developers, we noticed the problem of rewriting the same components each time we start a new frame project.

Stop worrying about Tailwind rules and HTML tags that don't work on frame development.

From now you can use Maiton and build faster 👊🏼

It shares insights on key trends — like stablecoins, L2s, and AI — plus, crypto’s rise as a policy issue, new data on builders and users, and more.

7 takeaways from the report:

1. Crypto activity and usage hit all-time highs

2. Crypto has become a key political issue ahead of the U.S. election

3. Stablecoins have found product-market fit

4. Major scaling upgrades have drastically reduced onchain transaction costs

5. DeFi remains popular — and it’s growing

6. Crypto could solve some of AI’s most pressing challenges

7. More scalable infrastructure has unlocked new onchain applications

It's ok not to be ok.

Life is lifing and has put me in a really bad place emotionally and mentally.
Pas few months/weeks been really hard.

And it's not over yet.
Lots of things to sort out IRL and it's not gonna be jolly.

Wearing the ""everything is awesome"" mask on a daily basis has become unbearable so here i am, as i am.

Not looking for sympathy,  just to explain why I'm not there as often as i used to.

Still love you though😘

you can say your launcher is for dog coins only or tailored specifically for medium-term, low-supply coins with hats. it doesn’t matter

fees will go to zero over time no matter what. it doesn’t matter

everything you’re promising is already in development elsewhere. it doesn’t matter 

“it’s better for the consumer!” sir… what consumer? there are 5,000 of us. it doesn’t matter 

the 3 competitors that launched in the first month? race to zero

now two more? what do you think?

why?

it has nothing to do with your fee structure or USPs

you launched a clone product into a saturated market that has zero liquidity & 10k users TAM—half of which are already tied to an existing eco 

further, the first-mover product has already created a burgeoning ecosystem that consists of ~90% of ALL liquidity that’s here outside of degen & higher

I’ve been a believer in Degen from day one. The vibes are there: Fun and degen ideas, experimenting with new tech, mechanisms and ultimately doing good stuff with this energy! 

That’s the core philosophy behind our latest project /ottodao 🐸
We want to hack on fun mechanisms and experiences and funnel all that Degen energy into funding good causes. We hope many of you will join us on this journey!

@lottopgf was born as a Degen lottery, PowerBALD. We gave away millions of Degen to winners, raised funds for public goods and ultimately this hype made us realize the potential of funneling Degen energy into good outcomes. And we got so many fun ideas!

Looking back I’m grateful for this year. Degen has allowed me to explore new directions in life, with a more open mindset and being able to focus on experiments that showcase the *good* things in crypto.

Price targets? I’d say .025,0.03,0.037 in the midterm, respectively.

Alanna is a unique artist who blends wool craft with cutting-edge AI tools to spread joy and mischief.

Additionally, @wake.eth, @zeni.eth, @maretus.eth, @alemac, @itslemon.eth, @samanthaeharvey and @dirtykumquats have teamed up with me to drop a 3-week 200k+ $ALFA 'stake bomb' on @fercaggiano, on whose channel I recently built a 23k $ALFA long-term staking position.

Fer is a tremendously skilled artist who offers 1-on-1 consultations about making, collecting and marketing art.

Join us in supporting creators who inspire belief through their dedication and talent.

Subscribe and stake to their channels and use 'eirrann's list' on Zeni's @alfafrens Channel Hunter website to discover more great artists.

1. WHAT IS YOUR DREAM?
To raise my son as a good man.

2. SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU:
I have been on TV for the most random occasions, among them for being vegetarian, another time for living in a Buddhist temple, and another as part of a TV show on furniture remodeling - besides a lot of art-related interviews.

3. FAVORITE SINGER OR MUSICAL BAND:
Too many... hard to pick one but let's go with Tori Amos.

4. COOL PEOPLE YOU MET IN FC?
I really admire @wake.eth. I've been on his AF channel since the beginning and even though he tries to say he's not nice, he's actually a gem and really supportive. 

Also, on Farcaster Fridays, I met @robin. So down to earth and kind! 

And I have to mention @montana, we met at a tech meetup and exchanged Farcaster contact details before the big rush here. They're all lovely people!

5. YOUR PLACE IN THE WORLD:
Place of birth: Sao Paulo, Brazil
Current residence: Miami, FL, USA

My project, ""MoxieScout and More,"" is a finalist for a MoxieRetro Grant.

Today, I'd like to humbly request your vote for me, @zeni.eth 🗳️

Here's the link to vote: link.moxie.xyz/retro1

---

Since Moxie's launch, I've been building full-time to create the most valuable community tools I can: @moxiescout , MoxieRank, MoxieChart, the Open Source Frame, and FanSpace (the myspace frame).

It's been so much fun.

I love Farcaster.

I love this community.

I'm not the type to hype up my own work. Though I share ""build-in-public"" casts and product updates, I prefer to highlight others.

Today, however, I need to honor those who have supported me — this community and my family — by putting my best foot forward.

A vote from you, big or small, is truly valuable to me.

Thank you :)

Warmly,

now for the first time since feb, daus *appear* to have broken trend; time will tell if the fc team cares enough to capitalize

you would think with hostility increasing on x, a ban on launchpad tech & overall user dissatisfaction, acquiring these users would be top priority

instead we offer them $5 for a good cast plus a $3 sign-up fee…

they’re collecting $1600 a month on x

by Bruegel the Elder 🇳🇱
oil on oak wood, 124 cm x 170 cm
Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, Austria

About the artwork:

The painting depicts Christ carrying the Cross amidst a large, detailed landscape, a setting that Bruegel often incorporated into his works. Bruegel's treatment of landscape evolved from extensive bird's-eye views to a more naturalistic style, evident in this painting. The landscape reflects the rocky, unfamiliar terrain of the Holy Land, drawing on the Antwerp school's landscape tradition.

Bruegel's composition is traditionally mannerist, with Christ depicted as insignificant among the crowds, contrasting with the dramatic events in the background. The sacred figures, including the fainting Virgin Mary, are separated from the main events, acting out their drama largely unnoticed 🙂☕️",1733045725000,528707,ghostbo4,Ghost 🎩,2198,1227,3,2,2,0,,True,sartocrates

- First, there's a significant liquidity migration from Solana to Base.
- I expect this to 100x in the coming weeks or months.
- Liquidity drives speculation, speculation drives attention, attention drives narrative, and narrative drives belief. Time rewards believers.
- My guess is that Zora Labs will never launch a token associated with wow protocol (legal reasons). What does that tell you? Re-read, think, and then think again.
- I believe wow protocol will 100x the impact of Pump.fun, but built on Base + strong culture and community vibes;
- I mean, it’s the @wow handle, the wow.xyz domain, the /wow FC channel - a full suite of bold moves to own the signal (kudos Zora).
- Also, the token is 100% fair launch. Jeets are out; only long-term believers are in.

- Traded, lost money, made more – thanks to $Flavia (still holding).
- If you're going to gamble, get ready – it's brutal.
- Reminded me a lot of the '19/'20 vibes.
- Builders are building, farmers are farming, dreamers are dreaming. This is driving a tremendous amount of attention and innovation.
- Product UX is better than current L2s (wallets, trading, minting).

Highly recommend giving it a go.

- even if this person pays noah (which to be clear they said *after the fact*), they still control the contract forever. if the token got massive, that's major leverage they do not deserve over his project.
- there's already a token, so splitting attention could crash the price of the other coin and/or confuse people, which hurts Noah and his game.
- this person might just be messing around, but someone in the future might actually mean harm, and they can do a lot more damage than ppl realize.

If clanker continues to run it'll be the default way to fair launch a token period, so I think it's important that we all figure out the right norms, and that means pushing back when I or others disagree with an action.",1733285506000,473,matthew,Matthew,256398,2878,2,1,0,0,,,matthew

Poolfish is a website and tool for Liquidity Providers to help them find pools and calculate fees to make decisions for providing liquidity.

Some stats:
- I've made $80k from the site over the last year.
- $32k of that was one-off deals with dexes
- ~140k pageviews per month
- Most of this traffic is direct or from Google (ranks #1 for a couple key terms)
- supports 6 different dexes including Uniswap
- supports multiple chains
- it can be ran fairly passively.

How it's made money.
- crypto companies sponsoring the site
- pro plan that is currently doing $630 MRR
- video course teaching liquidity providing

Let me know if you're interested!

And on the future not sure—but obv I want FC to win (whatever that means, don't think it's clear at all). Frames are the major innovation still IMO, but it's not clear yet that FC will capture the long term value of the idea.

It's entirely AI generated—no input from me. Every game is created from a single GPT prompt, which generates the theme, questions, and answers.
 
To check if a guess is ""close enough"" to an answer, I prompt GPT to return 20 alternate phrasings, conjugations, categories etc for each answer and then vectorize each. Every time you guess, I check the guess against those vectors to find a sufficiently similar answer or alternate.

So you get that second article sensation. Now, if you're in that second article, when you click another link, now you're going to pay well. And then you're going to realize, oh, I have to pay to get this.”

1. The overwhelming top complaint about the new channels is “I lost access” / “I can’t cast in the channels I used to”

2. The root of this is channels ran for a year as public topics / hashtags and we nudged people to cast in channels for a minor distribution boost.

3. When we launched channels last year, one of the fears was people wouldn’t cast in channels, since Twitter has tried versions of this and people were too used to casting on main / in the home timeline. 

4. Farcaster user behavior was more nascent / “plastic” / early adopters. So we ended up getting most people to cast in channels.

5. The other reality is most people want to maximize distribution. So telling them “channels = more distribution” is hard to unlearn, esp. if you’re more of a weekly active user.",1728767645000,3,dwr.eth,Dan Romero,495350,3570,177,13,41,0,,True,matthew

Just as e-commerce companies use Stripe to embed financial services, defi & creator protocols use Splits to enhance their products (i.e. Zora).

Stripe makes billions off of their financial services. But Splits is not a platform. It's a protocol. All the smart contracts they've developed are open for anyone to use for free as long as the Ethereum network is alive.

So what's the business model for the Splits Product (not protocol)?

I believe @w @abram and the team are building the essential infra for the rise of Onchain SMBs. Just as LLCs unlocked a new wave of innovation, Onchain SMBs will do the same by reducing the time for small teams to experiment w capital.

We're still at v0.0001 but as early onchain creators such as myself, @coopahtroopa.eth, etc. show value, we'll see many others cross the chasm.

@klip you can get a loan using degen as collateral on Teller :) Its also much more friendly than normal margin call lending. Teller does not use orcales and you cannot be liquidated by market price fluctuations. 

You can think of it like a cash advance or a line of credit, you put up your degen as collateral and then as long as you repay your loan on time and the interest owed then you get 100% of your degen back, even if the price plummets. 

The loans are short term, fixed rate, up to 30 days. Also you can repay or extend at anytime, as long as there is liquidity for the offer. 

This hasnt been fully announced yet... but we are working with Jacek and we have created a degen community ATM. If you use the degen atm then .5% of the loan volume will go to the degen community deployer address :)

🔹 Conduit Thursday where Degen dropped ~30% on the Conduit news to low of around $0.007

I’ve been a believer in Degen from day one. The vibes are there: Fun and degen ideas, experimenting with new tech, mechanisms and ultimately doing good stuff with this energy! 

That’s the core philosophy behind our latest project /ottodao 🐸
We want to hack on fun mechanisms and experiences and funnel all that Degen energy into funding good causes. We hope many of you will join us on this journey!

@lottopgf was born as a Degen lottery, PowerBALD. We gave away millions of Degen to winners, raised funds for public goods and ultimately this hype made us realize the potential of funneling Degen energy into good outcomes. And we got so many fun ideas!

Looking back I’m grateful for this year. Degen has allowed me to explore new directions in life, with a more open mindset and being able to focus on experiments that showcase the *good* things in crypto.

We are now in the confirmation phase(of which could become a correction phase if market conditions are unstable).

With this, I expect $degen to continue its bullish move to the $.023-025 region from the current market price($.021).

And if the current market price is unable to hold, we could see a draw down back to around $.0195 then maybe continue the rally to the $.023-025 region(as earlier stated).

Ps: This is all within a 4H timeframe chart and it is all subject to change depending on market conditions.

What is /burrfrens ?
- Burr Frens is the largest and most thriving poker community on Farcaster, and it's completely FREE to play. Launched during the depths of the bear market, Burr Frens quickly became a hub for Farcasters who share a love for poker and enjoy coming together in this vibrant community.

Please keep in mind!
- Burrfrens is an ECO ITO, which means there are no guaranteed airdrops or profits for tippers. Instead, this ITO supports projects that contribute to the /degen and /farcaster ecosystems.

The latest DEGEN chart shows a potential short-term uptrend forming. If the price can break above the $0.01950 resistance, it might push higher to $0.01960 or even $0.01970. However, if the $0.01925 support fails, we could see a pullback to the $0.01920 range.

My story recently racked up over 100 million views on this website.

As a startup founder in Norway I was facing an unrealized gains tax bill many times higher than my net income. No politician ever told me how I'm supposed to pay the bill, but I got put up on the Socialist Left party's ""Wall of Shame"" for speaking up.

With 100 of the top 400 tax payers leaving in just a couple of years present day Norway has chilling similarities to Ayn Rands 1957 dystopia ""Atlas Shrugged"".

I've written a post about why my motherland, one of the richest countries in the world, is facing an entrepreneurial exodus, how we got here and what the future might hold.
